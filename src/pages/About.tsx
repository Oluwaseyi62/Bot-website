              <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
                What started as Oluwaferanmi's passion project in 2018 quickly evolved into a movement. The first collection, featuring just 12 statement pieces, sold out within weeks of launch. This overwhelming response confirmed our belief that fashion enthusiasts were hungry for designs that didn't just follow trends but defined them.

                Today, ZYNTH has grown into a respected name in contemporary fashion, with our pieces being shipped to style-conscious customers worldwide.
